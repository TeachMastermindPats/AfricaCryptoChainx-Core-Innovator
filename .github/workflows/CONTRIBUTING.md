### Changes Made:
1. **Layer Efficiency**:
   - Combined multiple `RUN` commands where possible to reduce the number of layers in the final image.
   - Cleaned up the `apt` lists after installation to minimize the image size.
   
2. **Logical Flow**:
   - Simplified `RUNNER_ARCH` and `DOCKER_ARCH` selection using conditional statements.
   
3. **Docker and Buildx**:
